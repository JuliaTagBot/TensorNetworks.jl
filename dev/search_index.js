Based on this, common tensor networks in condensed matter physics with different structures are defined, such as the matrix product states (MPS), matrix product operators (MPO), etc. Construction of these tensor networks from a usual fermionic/hard-core-bosonic/spin system is also supported, which depends on the symbolic operator representation of a quantum lattice system that is generated by the package QuantumLattices.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Python-counterpart-1","page":"Home","title":"Python counterpart","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"HamiltonianPy: in fact, the authors of this Julia package worked on the python package at first and only turned to Julia later.","category":"page"}]
