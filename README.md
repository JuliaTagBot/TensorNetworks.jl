Julia package for the tensor networks in condensed matter physics.

## Introduction

This package provides definitions and methods of dense and sparse multi-labeled tensors. Based on this, common tensor networks in condensed matter physics with different structures are defined, such as the matrix product states (MPS), matrix product operators (MPO), etc. Construction of these tensor networks from a usual fermionic/hard-core-bosonic/spin system is also supported, which depends on the **symbolic operator representation** of a quantum lattice system that is generated by the package [`QuantumLattices`](https://github.com/Quantum-Many-Body/QuantumLattices.jl).

## Note

Due to the fast development of this package, releases with different minor version numbers are **not** guaranteed to be compatible with previous ones **before** the release of v1.0.0. Comments are welcomed in the issues.
